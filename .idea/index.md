# Progressive Web App
* Refers to couple of features to your web app to feel and work more like native apps **(Offline support, device camera, location, data sync in background, background sync)**.
<br/>

* It should be **reliable** : Load fast and provide offline functionality.
* **Fast**: Respond quickly to user action. 
* **Engaging**: Feels like a native app on mobile devices. 

## **Benefits for PWA over Native Apps**

* Native apps requires knowledge of atleast 2 languages(for android or ios). 
* 80% of time of usage of native apps goes to top3 apps so it's not going to be your app. 
* Web apps have more user reachage than native apps.

> **Tip**: We can use lighthouse to do audit of our PWA.
